## Instructions

- Clone this repository into a personal private repository in Github.
- Add `rogermadjos`, `kugtong33`, and `ccpacillos` as collaborators to the repository.
- Implement the components in `index.ts` file inside each one of the numbered directories (`#1`, `#2`, `#3`) so that the test cases defined inside the test files (`*.spec.ts`) pass all the assertions.
- The test cases defined in the test files also serve as specifications to the implementation of the said components.
- Any third-party packages from `npm` or other sources may be used.
- Submit the link to the personal private repository.

## Modification

I did some few modification for my part since I am still not satisfied with the result that I did doing google search and wanna learn more about what exercise is this and how to implement them in an api or in a server.

- I Modified the `tsconfig` for the `noUnusedParameters` to be commented and to run my `server.ts`
- I added `cross-env` to the `package.json` since `npm run test` is not working for me.
- I added `server.ts` to run my server and test my exercise there
- I added `npm run dev` for the server to run
- I added various end-point api localhost for my visual testing such as `/setcache`, `/getcache`, `/avail` , and `/ys` for the different exercise that I did.

overall It was challenging for me and I just search the formula for some of the exercise though I tried to understand them so that I can implement them in the future as long I understand the code and the flow thats fine by me. I have a long way to go and learn stuff since I am new to the industry and a fresh graduate.
